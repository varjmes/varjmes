Hi! My name is James (he/him) and I'm a Senior Developer.

I taught myself to code at the end of 2014 and since then I've worked across many Open Source projects and for many companies.

For me, code is a means to and end and the most important part of any team/project/company is its people.
I'm dedicated to providing inclusive experiences at every level and work on creating safe spaces for queer, trans, disabled and neurodiverse folk (and more!).

I myself am queer, trans and autistic.
