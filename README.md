Hi! My name is James (he/him) and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at The Financial Times.

I taught myself to code at the end of 2014 and since then I've worked for Marks &amp; Spencer, uSwitch and Condé Nast.

For me, code is a means to and end and the most important part of any team/project/company is its people.
I'm dedicated to providing inclusive experiences at every level and work on creating safe spaces for queer, trans, disabled and neurodiverse folk (and more!).

I myself am queer, trans and autistic.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **[Mathematics](https://www.notion.so/semj/Maths-4794170e2c034708a40037bdf3890dc1) and GraphQL**

Although I chose to live a much quieter existence and stopped doing the following; you may know me from my international conference talks on Open Source, my work with Hoodie.js, as a co-founder of WeAllJS or as the founder of YourFirstPR.
